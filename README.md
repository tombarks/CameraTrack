# CameraTrack
Arduino based camera tracking system. Developed as a collaborative effort between two Chepstonians. Final design goal is a dual motor camera track system allowing for stepped linear motion along the camera track over a fixed time period, rotatation of the camera body about the vertical axis and automatic triggering of camera.

11 May 2015 - Initial test code to demonstrate control of stepper motor for camera track using Ardunio Duemilanove and Adafruit Motor Controller - V2.3 http://www.adafruit.com/product/1438
